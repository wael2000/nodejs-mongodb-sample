# NodeJS-MongoDB-Sample
A simple NodeJS web application which communicates with MongoDB. Useful for testing Eclipse Che Node workspace.

This example was adapted from https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-code-samples/tree/master/nodejs/nodejs-guestbook

# MongoDB
The application connects to the Mongo data base, so it should be configured with next parameters:
- MongoDB user - <b>user</b>
- MongoDB password - <b>password</b>
- The name of data base - <b>guestbook</b>

#  Run the application
- Launch a workspace from the devfile.yaml file in this repo, eg., from https://devspaces.apps.your-cluster.com/#https://github.com/crw-samples/nodejs-mongodb-sample/tree/devspaces-3-rhel-8
- Open the Workspace tab (click the cube icon on the far right side) and look for commands (gear icon)
- Click '1-run' to run the application. The same command is documented in the devfile.yaml in this repo.
